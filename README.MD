# Pelican

A Basic TUI built in ocaml to show links between various markdown files

## todo: 
- Fill out the actual dune project stuff with maintainer info and the likes
- Create the acutal GUI
- Parse the actual markdown to make connections

## Possible
- Maybe a tagging system? Based on keywords or something? Not really sure

## Running:
For now just clone it and dune exec pelican
